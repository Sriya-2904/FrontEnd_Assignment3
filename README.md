# FrontEnd_Assignment3
In this Repository, I have uploaded HTML file, CSS file, and Assets for a mini assignment. 
The mini assignment is about Static and Basic Website Header Using HTML &Â CSS. It is completely based on how you can simply design a website header using HTML and CSS as beginner. For this website header design, we will simple design a header named Fruitopia.
All in all, Fruitopia is considered as a mini assignment where we can learn how to make basic and elegant header page.

You can find the explanation of what, and why these elements are used in the CSS in the medium article
