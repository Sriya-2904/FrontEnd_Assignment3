# FrontEnd_Assignment3
In this Repository, I have uploaded HTML file, CSS file, and Assets for a mini assignment. 
The mini assignment is about Static and Basic Website Header Using HTML &Â CSS. It is completely based on how you can simply design a website header using HTML and CSS as beginner. For this website header design, we will simple design a header named Fruitopia.
All in all, Fruitopia is considered as a mini assignment where we can learn how to make basic and elegant header page.
